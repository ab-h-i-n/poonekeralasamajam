        <h2>History Timeline</h2>
        <p>
          In pre-Independence days, the population of Pune (then known as Poona) was hardly 2 to 3 lakhs including a few thousands of Malayalees, mainly bachelors,  employed at different Central  Government establishments and  residing at different parts of Pune (Poona). If there was a  concentration (if at all it can be  called a concentration) of a few hundreds of Malayalees, it was at  places like Rasta Peth and Kirkee  (now known as Khadki). The  reason for this concentration of  Malayalees at these places was  that there were a few lodge-cum- eateries run by Malayalees  providing food and shared accommodation at an affordable  cost of less than Rs.50/- per  month/per person.
        </p>
        <p>A few  years after its birth, Poona Keraleeya Samaj (popularly known as PKS) was bifurcated into two separate organizations – one named as ‘East Poona Kerala Samaj’, which was set up Kirkee (Khadki) and the other continued to be known as ‘Poona Keraleeya Samaj’ and remained at its original place at 356, Rasta Peth, where it continues to exist even today.  Poona Keraleeya Samaj was registered with the Charity Commissioner, Pune Region, as a Charitable and Social Organization in the year 1944 under Registration No…….</p>

              <h2> Formation of ‘PKS’</h2>
              <small>1964</small>
              <p>In the past, Central Government employees in Pune earned less than Rs.100 per month.
                Many Malayalees in Pune sent money home to Kerala, leaving little for entertainment.
                Lacking a common place to socialize, some decided to form the 'Poona Keraleeya Samaj'
                in late 1930 at 356, Rasta Peth. Later, the group split into 'East Poona Kerala Samaj'
                in Kirkee and 'Poona Keraleeya Samaj' at Rasta Peth. In 1944, Poona Keraleeya Samaj was
                registered as a charitable and social organization.
